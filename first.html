    <p> Flowers With a History
        Scientists say there are over 270,000 species of flowers that have been documented and are living in the 21st Century. But scientists have yet to answer basic questions about these marvels of beauty... What led to their amazing diversity? Are there flowers that have not changed much during the evolution of this planet?
        
        The first plant fossils found were woody magnolia-like plants dating back 93 million years. Paleobotanists have more recently uncovered tiny herb-like flower fossils dating back 120 million years. Flowering plants, called angiosperms by scientists, were believed to be already diverse and found in most locations by the middle of the Cretaceous period… 146 million years ago. A myriad of images of preserved flowers and flower parts [in very fine detail] have been found in fossils located in Sweden, Portugal, England, and along the Eastern and Gulf coasts of the United States. Below are a few brief histories of some of today’s best loved flowers.

        <br>
     <p> Peduncle: The stalk of a flower. 
        Receptacle: The part of a flower stalk where the parts of the flower are attached.
        <br> 
        Sepal: The outer parts of the flower (often green and leaf-like) that enclose a developing bud.
        <br> 
        Petal: The parts of a flower that are often conspicuously colored.
        <br> 
        Stamen: The pollen producing part of a flower, usually with a slender filament supporting the anther.
        <br> 
        Anther: The part of the stamen where pollen is produced.
        <br> 
        Pistil: The ovule producing part of a flower. The ovary often supports a long style, topped by a stigma. The mature ovary is a fruit, and the mature ovule is a seed. 
        <br>
        Stigma: The part of the pistil where pollen germinates. 
        <br>
        Ovary: The enlarged basal portion of the pistil where ovules are produced.</p>
